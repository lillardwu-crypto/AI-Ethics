Grunwaldzki 2, 50-384, Wroclaw, Poland\\nAbstract. We consider the stochastic equation Xd=AX+BwhereAis a random diagonal\\nmatrix and X,Bare random vectors, X,Aare independent and the equation is meant in\\nlaw. We prove that Xis regularly varying in a multivariate nonstandard sense. T he results\\nare applicable to stochastic recursions with diagonal matr ices, in particular, to multivariate\\nautoregressive models like CCC-GARCH or BEKK-ARCH.\\nKey words.

Under mild contractivity hypotheses\\n[5], the sequence Xnconverges in law to a random vector X.Xis the unique solution to the\\nequation\\n(1.2) Xd=AX+B,\\nwhere(A,B)is a generic copy of (An,Bn),Xis independent of (A,B)and the equation is\\nmeant in law. If the process (1.1) is started from X0=Xthen it becomes stationary.\\nThere has considerable interest in various aspects of the it eration (1.1) and, in particular,\\nthe tail behavior of X, [1], [9], [20], [22].\\nIn this paper we focus on the case when the matrix A=diag(A1,...,Ad)is diagonal and we\\nmake the story more general. Suppose that (1.2) is satisﬁed b utXandBare not necessarily\\nindependent and possibly there is no iteration behind. Assu me however that XandAare\\nindependent. Are we still able to describe the tail of Xand is it of any interest anyway?\\nIt turns out that such a situation appears naturally when Gau ssian multiplicative chaos is\\nconsidered [36].\\nSuppose that (1.2) is satisﬁed, A=diag(A1,...,Ad)andX= (X1,...,X d)are independent.\\nUnder so called Kesten-Goldie conditions ((2.2)-(2.4)), w e prove that Xis regularly varying\\nE-mail address :ewa.damek@math.uni.wroc.pl .\\n2010Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation.

More precis ely, letB= (B1,...,Bd), and,\\namong other things, we assume that\\n(1.3) for every jthere isαj>0such that E|Aj|αj= 1.\\nThen the behavior of marginals Xjfollows from [20]. Namely, for every j\\nXjd=AjXj+Bj\\nand, under assumptions (2.2)-(2.4) below,\\n(1.4) lim\\nt→∞P(±Xj>t)tαj=cj,±,\\nsee Theorem 6.3. In fact (1.4) was proved in [20] only when (Aj,Bj)andXjare indepen-\\ndent but all what is needed is the Goldie Implicit Renewal The orem 6.1 and only o slight\\nmodiﬁcation is needed to get it in our framework, see Theorem 6.3.\\nSinceα1,...,αdmay be diﬀerent, we cannot expect the standard multivariate regular vari-\\nation i.e. existence of the weak limit of measures\\n(1.5) P(/bardblX/bardbl−1X∈U| /bardblX/bardbl>t)ast→ ∞,\\nHere/bardbl /bardblis the Euclidean norm and Udenotes a Borel subset of the sphere. Instead, we\\nneed to introduce an appropriate norm |·|αand an appropriate scaling δtas it is suggested\\nin [28]:\\n(1.6) δt(x) = (t1/α1x1,...,t1/αdxd).\\nNotice that, if cj,±>0then by (1.4)\\nP(±Xj>t1/αj)∼cj,±t−1\\ni.e. the tails of the marginals Xjnormalized this way behave as t−1and so it makes sense\\nto ask for\\n(1.7) lim\\nt→∞tP(δt−1X∈ ·),\\nwhere·stands for a Borel subset of Rd\\\\{0}. We prove that the above limit exists, Theorem\\n2.15, deﬁnes a Radon measure ΛonRd\\\\{0}and implies regular variation in the nonstandard\\nsense. For the origin of non standard regular variation (1.7 ) we refer the reader to [32], section\\n6.5.6 and further development in [30]. See also section 4.4. 10 in [10].\\n1.1.Matrix iterations. Stochastic iterations (1.1) have been studied since the sev enties\\nand they found numerous applications to ﬁnancial time serie s models [10, Section 4], [21], [34],\\n[35] as well as to risk management [29, Sec. 7.3]), [15]. Rece ntly asymptotic independence\\nof regularly varying marginals have been considered in the c ase of neural networks [24] and\\nmethods coming from SREs ([6, 23, 28]) have been adopted.\\nThe ﬁrst set of conditions implying regular behavior of Xin the sense of (1.8) below was\\nformulated by Kesten [22] for matrices with positive entrie s. Since then, Kesten conditions\\nand their extensions have been used to characterize tails in various situations, an essential\\nfeature being the same tail behavior in all directions [1, 9, 19]. To put it simply, it means\\nthat there is a Radon measure on Rd\\\\{0}being the weak limit of\\n(1.8) tαP(t−1X∈ ·),whent→ ∞,\\nfor someα>0. (1.8) follows from certain irreducibility or homogeneity of the action of the\\ngroup generated by the support of the law of A. However, this property is not necessarily\\nDIAGONAL STOCHASTIC RECURRENCE EQUATION 3\\nshared by all models interesting both from theoretical and a pplied perspective [25], [26],\\n[28], [30]. In particular, it does not hold for diagonal matr ices which constitute usually the\\nsimplest model for applications. Therefore, SREs with such A’s are both challenging and\\ndesirable.\\nRecently regular variation of the stationary solution Xto (1.1) has been proved in [28] for\\nthe case when\\n(1.9) A= (b1+c1M,...,b d+cdM)\\nwherebj,cj,j= 1,...,d are constants and the random variable Mis independent of B.\\nThe restrictive nature (1.9) and the absence of any other res ults on diagonal matrices shows\\nthat new methods are required and they are provided in this pa per. The key observation in\\n[28] is that, under (1.9), if αi/\\\\e}atio\\\\slash=αjthenXi,Xjare asymptotically independent i.e.\\n(1.10) P(|Xi|>t1/αi,|Xj|>t1/αj) =o/parenleftbig\\nP(|Xi|>t1/αi)/parenrightbig\\n=o(t−1)ast→ ∞.\\nWe are able to prove (1.10) in full generality i.e. under assu mption\\nP(|Ai|αi=|Aj|αj)<1,\\nand when only AandXare independent in (1.2) i.e. we do not require iterations, s ee Section\\n4.\\n1.2.Gaussian multiplicative chaos. In the theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos a\\nrandom measure MγonRdis studied [36]. Given an open set W⊂Rd, asymptotics of\\nP(Mγ(W)>t)ast→ ∞ is of interest. To prove that\\nP(Mγ(W)>t)∼t−α,ast→ ∞\\none dimensional equation X=AX+Ba.s. withX,Aindependent but X,Bbeing dependent\\nis used in [36] and Goldie Implicit Renewal Theorem 6.1 is app lied.\\nIt seems that also multivariate (1.2) with dependent X,Bmay be of interest while Gaussian\\nmultiplicative chaos is considered. The question has been a sk to the author by Tomas Kojar\\nand resulted in removing independence of XandBfrom the picture.\\n1.3.Applications to ﬁnancial models. There are various ﬁnancial models that satisfy\\n(1.1) and (1.2) with various assumptions on AandB. Then, to prove that the stationary\\nsolutionXis regularly varying, the results of [1, 9, 19, 22] have been u sed in [3, 25, 26, 30].\\nHowever they do not cover the most desirable case from the poi nt of view of applications:\\ndiagonal Awith arbitrary covariance matrix [cov(Ai,Aj)]and possibly diﬀerent tail indices\\nα1,...,αd. Our result ﬁlls the gap. When Theorem 2.15 is proved, the ana lysis of so-called\\nspectral process may be pursued as in [28].\\nSuppose, we consider a number of ﬁnancial assets - a vector su ch that the component-wise\\nreturns are described by univariate GARCH(1,1) processes. Then the squared volatilities\\nof components satisfy one dimensional SRE (1.1) and, under s uitable assumptions, they\\nare regularly varying but with possibly diﬀerent tail indic es. The returns inherit regular\\nvariation. It is natural to ask for the joint regular variati on under normalization (1.7).\\nRegular variation of Xis a convenient starting point to study extremal behavior of the\\nprocess in terms of the maxima and extremal indices, see e.g [ 30]. This helps to understand\\nthe most and the least risky assets in the above example and, g enerally, to study conditional\\nvalue at risk and risk measures [15]. It is possible to obtain the exremogram [25], point\\nprocess convergence [10, 30] as well as stable limit theory, see Section 4.5 of [10] or [9, 30].\\n4 E. DAMEK\\nNothing like that has been studied so far for the process (1.1 ) with diagonal matrices An\\nand now our results make it possible.\\nThe BEKK-ARCH process, introduced by Engle and Kroner [17] a nd originally deﬁned by\\na non-aﬃne recursion, has been written as (1.1) by Pedersen a nd Wintenberger [30]. They\\nstudied the regular behavior when assumptions of [9] or [1] a re applicable. [30], however,\\ndoes not cover diagonal BEKK models typically used in ﬁnance due to their relatively simple\\nparametrization, as discussed in Bauwens et al. [4]. This wa s probably the main motivation\\nof Mentemeier, Wintenberger to study diagonal SRE models an d to apply their result to\\nparticular cases of BEKK-ARCH and CCC-GARCH [28]. Also BEKK -ARCH with triangular\\nmatrices has been of interest, [26] but then only regular beh avior of components Xjfollows\\nfrom [12], [13], [14], [27].\\n2.Main results\\nRecall that A=diag(A1,...,Ad),B= (B1,...,Bd)∈Rd,\\n(2.1) Xd=AX+B\\nandA,Xare independent. We assume that for every j,\\n(2.2) log|Aj|conditioned on Aj/\\\\e}atio\\\\slash= 0 is non arithmetic .\\n(2.3) there is αj>0such that E|Aj|αj= 1\\n(2.4) E|Aj|αjlog+|Aj|<∞and there is σ>0such that,E|Bj|αj+σ<∞.\\n(2.2), (2.3) imply that\\n(2.5) −∞ ≤Elog|Aj|<0\\nand in view of (2.3), (2.4)\\n(2.6) 0<E|Aj|αjlog|Aj|<∞,\\nsee Theorem 6.1.\\nWe are going to use the same norm as in [28] i.e.\\n|x|α= max\\n1≤j≤d|xj|αjforx∈Rd\\n|·|αmay not be subadditive but there is always cα≥1such that\\n(2.7) |x+y|α≤cα(|x|α+|y|α).\\nForδtdeﬁned in (1.6), we have\\n|δt(x)|α=t|x|α.\\nFinally, let\\nSd−1\\nr={x∈Rd:|x|α=r}, Sd−1:=Sd−1\\n1\\nBr(0) ={x∈Rd:|x|α<r}, Br(0)c={x∈Rd:|x|α≥1}.\\nDIAGONAL STOCHASTIC RECURRENCE EQUATION 5\\nTheorem 2.8.

Theorem 2.8 is proved in Section 5. If XandBare independent then c∞>0\\nif and only if P(Ax+B=x)<1for everyx∈Rd. Strict positivity of c∞whenXandB\\nare possibly dependent is discussed below Theorem 2.15.\\nThe scheme of the proof is as follows. For i,j∈ {1,...,d}we deﬁne an equivalence relation\\nby\\ni∼jif and only if |Aj|αj=|Ai|αia.s.\\nwith associated equivalence classes Il,l= 1,...,p which without loss of generality may be\\nchosen asI1={1,...,d1},I2={d1+1,...,d1+d2}, etc. Then, we may write\\nRd=Rd1×...×Rdp,whereRdlcorresponds to Il,\\nand the stationary solution X= (X(1),...,X(p))to (1.2) satisﬁes\\n(2.10) X(l)d=A(l)X(l)+B(l), l= 1,...,p,\\nwithA(l)=diag(Ad1+...+dl−1+1,...,Ad1+...+dl),B(l)= (Bd1+...+dl−1+1,...,Bd1+...+dl). We are\\ngoing to refer to (2.10) as the homogeneous case , because then A(l)acts by homogeneous\\ndilations, see (3.8).\\nIn the next section we will prove (Theorem 3.1) that\\nlim\\nt→∞tP(|X(l)|α>t) =cl\\nand ifcl>0then the sequence of measures\\n(2.11) P/parenleftBig\\nδ|X(l)|−1\\nαX(l)∈U/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle|X(l)|α>t/parenrightBig\\n,\\nUa Borel subset of Sdl−1, tends weakly, as t→ ∞, to a probability measure νl.\\nSecondly, in Section 4, we consider the case i≁jand we obtain, for r1,r2>0,\\nP/parenleftbig\\n|Xj|>r1t1/αj,|Xi|>r2t1/αi/parenrightbig\\n=o(t−1),ast→ ∞,\\nwhich implies that for l/\\\\e}atio\\\\slash=q\\n(2.12) P/parenleftbig\\n|X(l)|α>r1t,|X(q)|α>r2t/parenrightbig\\n=o(t−1)ast→ ∞.\\nWe are also able to say something more about the speed in (2.12 ), see section 4.\\nThen identifying Sdl−1with\\n/tildewideSdl−1={x∈Rd:|x|α= 1,xi= 0fori /∈Il}\\nand proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 6.1 in [28], we concl ude Theorem 2.8 with the\\nlimit measure νhaving support in/uniontext\\n1≤l≤p/tildewideSdl−1, Section 5.\\n6 E. DAMEK\\n(2.9) may be formulated also in an alternative way that gives some more insight into the\\ntail behavior of X. For that we introduce polar coordinates related to the norm |·|αusing\\nthe map Φ :R+×Sd−1→Rd\\\\{0},\\n(2.13) Φ(s,ω) =δsω s>0, ω∈Sd−1\\nwhich is a homeomorphism.

Under assumption that XandBare independent and |A1|=...=|Ad|,\\nTheorem 3.1 was proved in [9, Theorem 2.8]. It turns out that a fter some modiﬁcations, the\\nproof follows in our setting. We just need to replace the eucl idean norm, which is used in\\n[9], by the norm | · |αas it is discussed in [9, Appendix D]. However, the details re quire a\\nconsiderable amount of work and so they are presented here.\\nDIAGONAL STOCHASTIC RECURRENCE EQUATION 9\\nAs in [9] we start with Ef(δt−1X)instead of using P(δt−1X∈ ·)immediately. Then, some\\nadditional regularity (Hölder) of fsimpliﬁes the proof and later on it may be gradually\\nrelaxed to arrive ﬁnally at (3.6).\\nProof. Step 1. Renewal equation. Leta=|A1|α1.Then\\n(3.8) |Ax|α=a|x|α=|δax|α.\\nIndeed,|Aixi|αi=|A1|α1|xi|αi. (3.8) means that then Aacts by homogeneous dilations. For\\nf∈C(Rd)we deﬁne\\n¯f(u) =Ef(δe−uX), u∈R\\nLetµbe a measure on Rdeﬁned by\\nµ(B) =P(loga∈B,a/\\\\e}atio\\\\slash= 0)\\nfor a Borel set B⊂R.

Therefore (3.9) becomes\\n(3.10) ψf(u) =¯f(u)−¯f∗µ(u) =Ef(δeuX)−Ef(δeuAX).\\n(3.10) is a renewal equation on Rbut unfortunately µis either a strictly subprobability\\nmeasure (P(A1= 0)>0))or, in view of (2.5), a probability measure with strictly neg ative\\nmean. Therefore, we change the measure multiplying both sid es of the equation by euand\\nwe have\\n/tildewideψ(u) :=euψf(u) =eu¯f(u)−eu¯f∗µ(u) =/tildewidef(u)−/tildewidef∗/tildewideµ(u),\\nwhere/tildewidef(u) =eu¯f(u)and/tildewideµ=euµ. Now, in view of (2.3) and (2.6), /tildewideµis a probability\\nmeasure on Rwith the positive mean m. Therefore, we may apply the renewal theorem on\\nR, see Theorem 7.2 in the Appendix, provided /tildewideψis direct Riemann integrable.\\nHowever, the above argument does not work if Aimay be negative because then δaX=\\n(|A1|X1,...,|Ad|Xd)/\\\\e}atio\\\\slash=AX.

Changing\\nthe order of coordinates, we may assume that for 1≤i≤n,P(Ai<0)>0, and for\\nn < i ,P(Ai<0) = 0 .

Finally writing f∗µ(g) =/integraltext\\nD¯f(g(g′)−1)dµ(g′)we obtain\\n(3.11) ψf(g) =¯f(g)−¯f∗µ(g) =Ef(δe−uk−1X)−Ef(δe−uk−1AX)\\nand the right renewal equation is\\n/tildewideψ(g) :=euψf(g) =eu¯f(g)−eu¯f∗µ(g) =/tildewidef(g)−/tildewidef∗/tildewideµ(g),\\nwhereg= (u,k),/tildewidef(u) =eu¯f(g)and/tildewideµ=euµ. As before,/tildewideµis a probability measure on R\\nwith the positive mean m=/integraltext\\nDu d/tildewideµ(u,k).

Suppose that Msatisﬁes the assumptions of the previous theorem, R,Mare\\nindependent,\\nRd=MR+Q, (6.4)\\nand there is σ>0such that\\n(6.5) E[|Q|α+σ]<∞.\\nThen there exist constants c±such that\\nlim\\nt→∞P(±R>t)tα=c±\\nasx→ ∞.\\nRemark. WhenRis independent of (M,Q), Theorem 6.3 was proved in [20] with σ= 0\\nand only a slight modiﬁcation is needed to conclude it in our s etting.\\nProof. Theorem 6.3 follows from Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 in [20]. On ly condition (6.2)\\nmust be checked and under (6.4) it becomes\\n/integraldisplay∞\\n0|P(±(MR+Q)>t)−P(±MR>t)|tα−1<∞.\\nThe above follows from\\nI=E/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftbig\\n(MR+Q)±/parenrightbigα−/parenleftbig\\n(MR)±/parenrightbigα/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<∞,\\nas it is explained in Lemma 9.4 in [20]. Indeed, if α≤1then\\nI≤/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(MR+Q)±−(MR)±/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα≤E|Q|α<∞\\nbecause for any a,b∈R,|a±−b±| ≤ |a−b|.

Then for every 0<s<α\\n(6.7) E|R|s<∞.\\nRemark. WhenRand(M,Q)are independent, (6.7) follows immediately from the\\nrepresentation Rd=/summationtext∞\\ni=0M1...Mi−1Qi,(Mi,Qi)being i.i.d with the same law as (M,Q),\\n[20].\\nProof. Letf(t) =P(|R|>t). We have to prove that/integraltext∞\\n0ts−1f(t)dt<∞. Letµbe the the\\nmeasure on R+deﬁned byµ(B) =P(|M| ∈B), for a Borel set B⊂R+. Observe that\\nEf(tM−1) =/integraldisplay\\nR+P(R>ts−1)dµ(s) =f∗µ(s),\\nwhere∗denotes the convolution on the multiplicative group R+. Let\\nψ(t) =f(t)−f∗µ(t) =P(|R|>t)−P(|MR|>t).\\nThen\\nf(t) =ψ(t)+f∗µ(t)\\nand so\\nf(t) =N/summationdisplay\\nm=0ψ∗µm(t)+f∗µN+1(t).\\nButf∗µN+1(t) =P(|M1...MN+1|> t)→0whenN→ ∞. Indeed,M1,...,M N+1are i.i.d,\\nandµis either a strictly subprobability measure (if P(|M|= 0)>0) or it is a probability\\nmeasure with Elog|M|<0. Therefore,\\n(6.8) f(t) =∞/summationdisplay\\nm=0ψ∗µm(t).\\nNow multiplying both sides of (6.8) by ts,s < α and writing/tildewidef(t) =tsf(t),/tildewideψ(t) =tsψ(t),\\n/tildewideµ=tsµwe have\\n/tildewidef=∞/summationdisplay\\nm=0/tildewideψ∗/tildewideµm=:/tildewideψ∗/tildewideU,\\nwhere/tildewideU=/summationtext∞\\nm=0/tildewideµmis a ﬁnite measure, because/tildewide(R+)<1.

Now suppose that α >1and\\n1≤s0= sup{s:Is<∞}<α. Takes0<s<s 0+1−s0/α. Then\\nIs≤smax(1,2s−2)E|Q|(|MR|s−1+|Q|s−1)\\nand we need to prove that E|Q||MR|s−1<∞.

IfRand(M,Q)are independent then c++c−>0if and only if for\\neveryx∈R,P(Mx+Q=x)<1i.e.Ris not constant, as it is shown in [20], Theorem 4.1.\\nMoreover, if P(M <0)>0thenc+=c−>0.\\nIfP(M≥0) = 1 ,c+,c−may not be equal and so we may ask when c+,c−>0. Conditions\\nfor strict positivity of c+,c−in the case P(M≥0) = 1 were ﬁrst given in [18] and then\\nelaborated and simpliﬁed in [10], [8].

In particular, it may happen that c+>0andc−= 0.\\nIfRandQmay be dependent none of the above methods works and then comp lex analysis\\nhelps. We may proceed as in [9]. In view of the observations ma de in [20], if (6.2) and (6.4)\\nare satisﬁed then\\n(6.11) c++c−=/integraldisplay∞\\n0(P(|MR+Q|>t)−P(|MR|>t))tα−1dt\\nand so under assumptions of Theorem 6.3, in view of Lemma 9.4 i n Goldie\\nc++c−=1\\nαmE(|MR+Q|α−|MR|α).\\nLet\\ns∞= sup{s:E|M|s+E|Q|s<∞}\\nand forz∈Cwe write\\nκ(z) :=E|M|z.\\nTheorem 6.12. Suppose that s∞>α. Thenc++c−= 0if and only if for every s<s∞\\n(6.13) E|R|s<∞.\\nRemark. It is reasonable to ask why and when (6.13) is not possible and it gives a\\ncontradiction.

The proof in [9] does not use independen ce ofQandR, so we may\\nconclude that c++c−is strictly positive if assumptions of Theorem 6.3 and (6.14 ) are\\n26 E. DAMEK\\nsatisﬁed. In various settings, (6.13) may be impossible for some speciﬁc reasons depending\\non the model.\\nProof. Suppose that c++c−= 0(the other direction is obvious by (6.10)). Let θ= sup{s:\\nE|R|s<∞}.\\nStep 1. First we shall prove that θ>α. Forz∈C,0≤ ℜzwe consider\\n(6.15) Λ(z) =E(|MR+Q|z−|MR|z).\\nIfℜz <α thenΛis well deﬁned and\\nΛ(z) =E|R|z−E|MR|z= (1−κ(z))E|R|z.\\nObserve that Λis well deﬁned for ℜz=α+δ,δ≤σ\\nα+σ,σas in (6.5). Indeed, if ℜz=α+δ >1\\nthen\\n|az−bz|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplayb\\nazrz−1dr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤ |z||a−b|max/parenleftbig\\naℜz−1,bℜz−1/parenrightbig\\n.\\nHence, with a=|MR|andb=|MR+Q|, we have\\n|Λ(z)| ≤ |z|max/parenleftbig\\n1,2α+δ−2/parenrightbig\\nE/parenleftbig\\n|Q|α+δ+|Q||MR|α+δ−1/parenrightbig\\n<∞.\\nIndeed, as before, for E|Q||MR|α+δ−1we use Hölder inequality with p=α+σ, q=α+σ\\nα+σ−1.\\nThen(α+δ−1)q<α and so\\nE|Q||MR|α+δ−1≤/parenleftbig\\nE|Q|α+σ/parenrightbig1/p/parenleftbig\\nE|MR|(α+δ−1)q/parenrightbig1/q<∞.\\nIf0≤Rz≤1then\\n(6.16) |az−bz| ≤(2|z|+3)|a−b|ℜz,\\n(see the proof below) and so\\n|Λ(z)| ≤(2|z|+3)E|Q|ℜz<∞.\\nStep 2. Now we shall conclude (6.13). Since κ′(α) =E|M|αlog|M|>0, the function\\nh(z) =Λ(z)\\n1−κ(z)\\nis well deﬁned and holomorphic in a neighborhood of α. Moreover, for ℜz <α ,\\nh(z) =E|R|z.\\nIn view, of Landau Theorem (Theorem 7.3) the abscissa of conv ergenceθof the law of |R|\\nis strictly larger then α. Now we shall prove that for every s<s∞\\nE|R|s<∞.\\nSuppose that θ<s∞and consider θ≤s≤θ+δ<s∞,δ≤σ\\nθ+σ.
